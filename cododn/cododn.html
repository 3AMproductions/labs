                    <p class="sessionAbstractText description">Nobody likes writing <acronym title="Create Read Update Delete">CRUD</acronym>. After writing an obscene number of methods and stored procedures you are left with a mountain of repetitive,error-prone,data access code.  Wouldn't it be great if you could spend that time writing actual business logic instead of being a plumber and writing the same old data access code?  In this talk Michael Eaton will introduce you to an open-source framework called Castle ActiveRecord that will help you write less data access code and be more productive.</p>
